  			My name is Jordan DeWitt and I am currently a digital media art major at San Jose State University. I am relatively new to the art world as I just became interested in art and became an art major only a couple years ago. My first ispirations came from one of my passions - anime. I really appreciate the things that anime can do as their visuals and effects are like none other. I try to emulate this in my works by creating works that are visually pleasing to the eye incorporating the the elements of art. I am currently learning many new things and picking up many different skills such as video editing, coding, Illustrator, sculpture, and many more. I hope to be able to incorporate all these different mediums to create pieces that others will enjoy.
